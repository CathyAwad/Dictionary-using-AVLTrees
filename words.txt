hello
it's
me
i was
wondering
if
after
all
these
years
you
really
would
like
to
meet
to
go
over
everything
they
say
time
supposed
to
heal
ya
but
i've
not
done
much
healing
hello
can 
you
hear
me
i'm
in
california
dreaming
about
who
we
used
to
be
when
we
were
younger
and
free
i've
forgotten
how
it
felt
before
the
world
fell
at
our
feet
there's
such 
a
difference
between
us
and
a million
miles
hello
from
the
other
side
i must
have
called
a thousand
times
to tell
you
i'm
sorry
for
everything
i've
done
but
when
i call
you
never
semm
to be
home
hello 
from
the 
outside
at
least
i can
say
that
i've
tried
to tell
you
i'm
sorry
for
breaking
your
heart
but
it
don't
matter
it
clearly
doesn't
tear 
you
apart
anymore
